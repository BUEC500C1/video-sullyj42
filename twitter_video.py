This module imports the twitter module built during the last assignment as a
submodule, and converts the output files to a format more friendly for building a video

There is no way to find tweets before a certain date, and I am ensure how "id" is incremented. 
So we will continue to call this portion of the code incrementally. 

Calls Google Vision in a queue structure as that is the most time-consuming portion of this
