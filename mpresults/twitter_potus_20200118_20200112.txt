مردم نجیب ایران، که آمریکا را دوست می دارند، سزاوار دولتی هستند که بیش از تمرکز بر کشتن آنها به جرم احترام خواهی، به آنها کمک کند تا به رؤیاهایشان دست یابند. رهبران ایران به جای آن که ایران را به سمت ویرانی بکشانند، باید هراس افکنی را کنار بنهند و ایران را دوباره باعظمت کنند!

مشاور امنیت ملی امروز عنوان کرد كه تحریم ها و اعتراضات، ایران را«به شدت تحت فشار»قرار داده است و آنها را مجبور به مذاكره می كند.در واقع، اصلا برایم اهمیتی نداردکه آیا آنها مذاکره می کنند یا نه.این کاملاً به عهده ی خودشان است، اما سلاح هسته ای نداشته باشیدو«معترضان خود را نکشید.» 

national security adviser suggested today sanctions &amp; protests iran “choked off”, force negotiate. actually, couldn’t care less negotiate. totally but, nuclear weapons “don’t kill protesters.”

many believe senate giving credence trial based evidence, crime, read transcripts, “no pressure”  impeachment hoax, rather outright dismissal, gives partisan democrat witch hunt credibility otherwise does have. agree!
