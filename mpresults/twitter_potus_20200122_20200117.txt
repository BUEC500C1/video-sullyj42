مردم نجیب ایران، که آمریکا را دوست می دارند، سزاوار دولتی هستند که بیش از تمرکز بر کشتن آنها به جرم احترام خواهی، به آنها کمک کند تا به رؤیاهایشان دست یابند. رهبران ایران به جای آن که ایران را به سمت ویرانی بکشانند، باید هراس افکنی را کنار بنهند و ایران را دوباره باعظمت کنند! 

the noble iran—who love america—deserve government that's more interested helping achieve dreams killing demanding respect. instead leading iran toward ruin, leaders should abandon terror iran great again! 

the so-called “supreme leader” iran, has been supreme lately, had nasty things united states europe. economy crashing, suffering. should very careful words!

words wisdom. ted!
